# Contributing to deproto

Thank you for your interest in contributing to deproto! This document provides guidelines and instructions for contributing to the project.

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lobstrio/deproto.git
cd deproto
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install development dependencies:
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

4. Set up pre-commit hooks:
```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

### Running Pre-commit

Pre-commit can be run in several ways:

1. Automatically on git commit:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "your message"  # pre-commit will run automatically
```

2. Manually on all files:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

3. Manually on specific files:
```bash
pre-commit run --files deproto/node.py tests/test_node.py
```

4. Run specific hooks:
```bash
pre-commit run black --all-files  # run only black
pre-commit run flake8 --all-files  # run only flake8
```

5. To skip pre-commit hooks temporarily:
```bash
git commit -m "your message" --no-verify
```

The pre-commit hooks will run automatically on `git commit` and check:
- Code formatting (black)
- Import sorting (isort)
- Linting (flake8)
- Various file checks (trailing whitespace, merge conflicts, etc.)

If any hook fails:
1. Review the error messages
2. Files may be automatically reformatted - check the changes
3. Stage the reformatted files: `git add .`
4. Try committing again

## Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints for function parameters and return values
- Include docstrings for classes and public methods
- Keep lines under 80 characters when possible

## Testing

All new features and bug fixes should include tests. The project uses pytest for testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest tests/

# Run with coverage
coverage run -m pytest tests/
coverage report
```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature/fix:
```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of your changes"
```

3. Ensure all tests pass and add new tests if needed
4. Update documentation if necessary
5. Push your changes and create a pull request

## Pull Request Guidelines

When submitting a pull request:

1. Describe the changes and why they're needed
2. Include any relevant issue numbers
3. Ensure all tests pass
4. Update CHANGELOG.md following the existing format
5. Add yourself to CONTRIBUTORS.md if you're not already listed
